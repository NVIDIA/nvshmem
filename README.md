# NVSHMEM Overview

NVSHMEM™ is a parallel programming interface based on OpenSHMEM that provides efficient and
scalable communication for NVIDIA GPU clusters. NVSHMEM creates a global address space for
data that spans the memory of multiple GPUs and can be accessed with fine-grained 
GPU-initiated operations, CPU-initiated operations, and operations on CUDA® streams.
